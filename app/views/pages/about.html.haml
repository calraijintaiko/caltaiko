        In the Spring of 2005, a small-but-committed group of students pooled
        together their resources and formed UC Berkeley's first taiko group.
        Since then, **Cal Raijin Taiko** has gone on to become Berkeley's
        premier Japanese drumming performance ensemble. With a repertoire
        consisting entirely of original compositions, Cal Raijin Taiko performs
        to spread the **knowledge**, **love**, and **passion** of taiko to both
        the campus and the surrounding communities.
