        In the Spring of 2005, a small-but-committed group of students pooled
        together their resources and formed UC Berkeley's first taiko group.
        Since then, **Cal Raijin Taiko** has gone on to become Berkeley's
        premier Japanese drumming performance ensemble. With a repertoire
        consisting entirely of original compositions, Cal Raijin Taiko performs
        to spread the **knowledge**, **love**, and **passion** of taiko to both
        the campus and the surrounding communities.

        In the decade since it's inception, the members of Cal Raijin Taiko have
        composed over a dozen unique and vibrant songs, and performed for scores
        of audiences large and small.
        Our **[alumni](#{URI.join(root_url, 'members/alumni')})** have spread
        throughout the country, many of them founding entirely new taiko groups
        in the cities where they settle. Every Fall we accept new members to
        make up the next Generation of our Cal Rajin Taiko family.
